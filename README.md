# cuddly-bassoon
The Ethereum Implementation Tutorial

__Why did you choose this name?__

github advised me to do so:

"Great repository names are short and memorable. Need inspiration? How about cuddly-bassoon."


__Why does this repository exist?__

I wanted to do an implementation of a simple ethereum client in easy to understand code.
And because I like to make myself challenges, to drive further work, I post these challenges and keep snapshots of their status, so that anyone can follow along, implementing their own client.
I'll track challenges/features in issues, but am listing the important ones in the readme, too.

I'll also upload test cases to see if my/your code works as intended

# Challenges

1. parse RLP encoded data
    - write a datastructure to capture RLP data
2. encode RLP trees
3. encode/decode hex values
4. hash byte arrays with keccak256
5. hash block0 (0xd4e56740f876aef8c010b86a40d5f56745a118d0906a34e69aec8c0db1cb8fa3)
    - find block0

# Tips and Tricks
- always have the yellow paper open
- sometimes it's helpful to look into other ethereum implementations (geth, pyethereum, cppethereum, ...)

# TODO
- expand challenge descriptions, to make it easier to follow along, maybe i'll make a blog post series out of this
    - include page references to the yellow paper
