# cuddly-bassoon
The Ethereum Implementation Tutorial

__Why did you choose this name?__

github advised me to do so:

"Great repository names are short and memorable. Need inspiration? How about cuddly-bassoon."


__Why does this repository exist?__

I wanted to do an implementation of a simple ethereum client in easy to understand code.
And because I like to make myself challenges, to drive further work, I post these challenges and keep snapshots of their status, so that anyone can follow along, implementing their own client.
I'll track challenges/features in issues, but am listing the important ones in the readme, too.

I'll also upload test cases to see if my/your code works as intended

# Challenges

1. parse RLP encoded data
    - write a datastructure to capture RLP data
2. encode RLP trees
3. encode/decode hex values
4. hash byte arrays with keccak256
